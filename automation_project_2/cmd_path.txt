if you want to change to a mapped drive use the above format in the command prompt to do so:


cd /d Q:\DRIVE\FOLDER\SUBFOLDER\ETC


if the drive is unmapped (or a UNC path) for example and looks like the below


\\bc-fps02\XXXXX\XXXXX


then you can use the following format:


pushd \\bc-fps02\XXXXX\XXXXX


then apply popd to exit from the above specified path
